Working with class inheritance.<br/>
The first class 'Parent' is the parent's class and to inherite from it, we use the keyword 'open' in front of the class declaration.<br/>
The second class is the 'Child' class which inherite from 'Parent' class.<br/>
Also working with array collection 'listOf()' ==> immutable array; 'arrayListOf' ==> mutable array.
